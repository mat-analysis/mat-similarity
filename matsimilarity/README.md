The present application offers a tool, to support the user in the data mining task of multiple aspect trajectories, specifically for measuring similarity of its complex data. It integrates into a unique platform the fragmented approaches available for multiple aspects trajectories and in general for multidimensional sequence classification into a unique web-based and python library system.
